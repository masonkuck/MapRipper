# Map Ripper
Map Ripper is a tool designed to dissect Google Maps into separate layers and output them for various use cases. I developed this to help with personal art projects. The output is great for edge-detection and converting to SVG files.

## Why?
I needed high quality SVG files of seperated map layers so that I can make personal works of art.

## TODO List
- Implement setting caching with Local Storage to make it easier to come back to the website in different states.
- Address navigation (Find your house or city easier)
- Save layers seperately into a ZIP folder for download.
- More layers, with more refined styles. Currenty the Parks layer has some labels still sticking around.
